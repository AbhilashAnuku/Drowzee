2. **Drowsiness Detection System**  
   - Video feed from webcam to monitor studentâ€™s alertness.
   - Uses real-time drowsiness detection algorithms to alert users if drowsiness is detected.
   - **Audio alerts** for specific conditions (e.g., 100% drowsiness score triggers sound notification).

3. **SQLite Database Integration**  
   - Stores user credentials securely with **hashed passwords** using `werkzeug.security`.
   - Tracks session details and activity logs.

4. **Flask-based Web App with Pyfladesk Integration**  
   - **Web GUI** initialized using Pyfladesk to provide a desktop application-like experience.
